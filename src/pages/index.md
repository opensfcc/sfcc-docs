You might be asking yourself, **"Are these the official SFCC docs?"** So let's get that out of the way first. **No.** This website is leveraging publicly available data to help improve SFCC developers' lives. {% .lead %}

## What's different?

{% quick-links %}

{% quick-link title="Deep linking" icon="installation" description="Share a URL to the exact thing you want without any fuss." /%}

{% quick-link title="Change history" icon="presets" description="View changes in documentation over time." /%}

{% quick-link title="Versioning" icon="plugins" description="We've embedded the API version directly into the URL." /%}

{% quick-link title="Auto themes" icon="theming" description="Support for light and dark modes to match your system preference." /%}

{% /quick-links %}

### We added

- Custom navigation with everything all in one place
- Flexible search engine with advanced indexing
- Future support for older API versions

### We left out

- No "Upcoming" documentation ( latest will be "Current" )
- No style guides, XSD, or docs comparing API versions
- No class lists, package lists, or overview pages
